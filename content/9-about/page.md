Title: About
---
Beacon House has been a source of assistance since 1985, helping families and individuals in the Bedford/Sackville/Fall River/Hammonds Plains area who have been faced with financial hardship as a result of job loss, reduced employment, medical issues, psychological or physical challenges, and many other life events that impact their ability to provide basic needs for themselves and their families.

With the help of more than 100 dedicated volunteers from the local community, our staff is able to offer hope and comfort to those in need as they work to get back on their feet and create a better future.

> The mission of Beacon House Interfaith Society is to work in a caring and compassionate manner to provide food and clothing to those in our community that need our help.

Beacon House is operated by a registered charity, the Christian Interfaith Society, a collaboration of local churches, and is a member agency of Feed Nova Scotia. Beacon House is guided by a volunteer Board of Directors.

Beacon House has grown over the decades from several small one-room locations in the Sackville area to our present location at 470 Cobequid Road where we have operated since 2003. Currently, we serve over 2500 clients, representing between 600 and 700 families, per month.

Beacon House is not funded by any government sources and we have sustained our operation through the sale of donated items in our retail store adjacent to the food bank, as well as donations from member churches, community groups, corporations and private individuals.
