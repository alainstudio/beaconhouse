Title: Retail Store
---

Our retail store is open to the public. We are a registered charity, so there is NO SALES TAX charged on the items we sell. Beacon House relies on the donation of goods from the community to support our operations. Sales from our retail store are used to manage our society and operate the food bank. Every dollar you spend in the retail store goes directly to helping those in need in our community. 

PLEASE NOTE: We accept CASH & DEBIT ONLY.
